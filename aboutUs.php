    <h3>The Freedom to Create</h3>

        Blender's mission is to bring the best 3D technology as tools in the hands of artists, for all platforms, everywhere in the world, free and open source forever.</p>
   <h3>Free and Open Source</h3>
    <p>
        Blender is a public project hosted on blender.org, licensed as GNU GPL, owned by its contributors.
        For that reason Blender is Free and Open Source software, forever.</p>
    <h3>Itâ€™s about people.</h3>
    <p>
        Designers, developers, engineers, artists. All driven by passion. All using Blender to make an impact.</p>
    <p>This webpage serves as a showcase for various artist's renders done with Blender.
    </p>
    <p>
        Blender is an open source tool and can be downloaded for free <a href="https://www.blender.org/" class="newsLink">Here</a>
    </p>
    <p>Users can post their renders and preview them in the "renders" section.
        Each post has an image of the render, title of the artwork, a short description and an in-depth explanation of methods used to achieve the render.
    </p>
    <p>Except for images, Blender can be used to create animations such as the one showcased on this page.</p>
